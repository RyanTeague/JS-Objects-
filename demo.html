 <!--JavaScript Objects

    Real Life Objects
    In real life, objects are things like: houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.

    Here is a car object example:
-->

<!--Object Properties
    A real life car has properties like weight and color:

    car.name = Fiat, car.model = 500, car.weight = 850kg, car.color = white.

    Car objects have the same properties, but the values differ from car to car.

    Object Methods
    A real life car has methods like start and stop:

    car.start(), car.drive(), car.brake(), car.stop().

    Car objects have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

    JavaScript Variables
    JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

    This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
-->
<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>
<h2>Creating a Variable</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create and a Variable:
let car = "Fiat";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Car: " +  car;
</script>

<hr>

<!--JavaScript Objects
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

    This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to an object named car:
-->
<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Creating an Object</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Display Data from the Object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The car type is " + car.type;
</script>

<hr>

<!--Note:
    It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.

    Learn more about using const with objects in the chapter: JS Const.

    Using an Object Constructor
    JavaScript Object Literal
    An object literal is a list of name:value pairs inside curly braces {}.

    {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}
    Note:
    name:value pairs are also called key:value pairs.

    object literals are also called object initializers.

    Creating a JavaScript Object   
    These examples create a JavaScript object with 4 properties:
-->
<h1>Creating JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Using an Object Literal</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

// Display Data from the Object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<!--Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object initializer can span 
    multiple lines:
-->

<h1>Creating JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Using an Object Literal</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Display Data from the Object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<hr>

<!--This example creates an empty JavaScript object, and then adds 4 
    properties:
-->
<h1>Creating JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Using an Object Literal</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an empty Object
const person = {};

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue"; 

// Display Data from Object
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<hr>

<!--Using the new Keyword
    This example create a new JavaScript object using new Object(), and 
    then adds 4 properties:
-->
<h1>Creating JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Using the new Keyword</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object
const person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue"; 

// Diplay Object Content
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<hr>

<!--Note:
    The examples above do exactly the same.

    But, there is no need to use new Object().

    For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.
-->

<!--Object Properties
    The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.

    Property	Value
    firstName	John
    lastName	Doe
    age	        50
    eyeColor	blue
    Objects written as name value pairs are similar to:

    Associative arrays in PHP
    Dictionaries in Python
    Hash tables in C
    Hash maps in Java
    Hashes in Ruby and Perl
    Accessing Object Properties
    You can access object properties in two ways:

    objectName.propertyName
    objectName["propertyName"]
-->
<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
<p>There are two ways to access a property: object.property or object["property"]</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     :  5566
};

// Display lastName from the Object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The last name is " + person.lastName;
</script>

<hr>

<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
<p>There are two ways to access a property: object.property or object["property"]</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object:

  id     :  5566
};

// Display lastName from the Object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The last name is " +  person["lastName"];
</script>

<hr>

<!--JavaScript Object Methods
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are function definitions stored as property values.

Property	Property Value
firstName	John
lastName	Doe
age	50
eyeColor	blue
fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}-->

<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Object Methods</h2>
<p>A method is a function definition stored as a property value.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>

<hr>

<!--In the example above, this refers to the person object:

    this.firstName means the firstName property of person.

    this.lastName means the lastName property of person.

    In JavaScript, Objects are King.
    If you Understand Objects, you Understand JavaScript.
    Objects are containers for Properties and Methods.

    Properties are named Values.

    Methods are Functions stored as Properties.

    Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects.

    In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

    Objects are objects
    Maths are objects
    Functions are objects   
    Dates are objects
    Arrays are objects
    Maps are objects
    Sets are objects
    All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

    JavaScript Primitives
    A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

    3.14 is a primitive value

    A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

    JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

    string
    number
    boolean
    null
    undefined
    symbol
    bigint
    Immutable
    Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

    if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.

    Value	Type	Comment
    "Hello"	string	"Hello" is always "Hello"
    3.14	number	3.14 is always 3.14
    true	boolean	true is always true
    false	boolean	false is always false
    null	null (object)	null is always null
    undefined	undefined	undefined is always undefined
    JavaScript Objects are Mutable
    Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

    If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:

    const x = person;
    The object x is not a copy of person. The object x is person.

    The object x and the object person share the same memory address.

    Any changes to x will also change person:
-->
<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Objects are Mutable</h2>

<p>Changes to a copy of an object will also change the original object:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age:50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Create a Copy
const x = person;

// Change Age
x.age = 10;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>
